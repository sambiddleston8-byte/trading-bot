# AI investment platform project status

This file keeps implementation continuity against the user-approved Master
Roadmap for the AI-Driven Investment Platform. The roadmap is the governing
architecture: work proceeds one phase at a time, GitHub remains the source of
truth, deterministic software is preferred for repeatable tasks, and autonomous
real-money trading remains disabled.

## Current phase

Phase 1 — Foundation, audit and decision ledger.

## Completed

- Repository, architecture, Git state and automated tests inspected.
- Protected development branch created: `codex/phase1-immutable-ledger`.
- Baseline confirmed at 115 passing tests before Phase 1 additions.
- Append-only, SHA-256 hash-chained investment decision ledger implemented.
- Git, portfolio, component, model and prompt version metadata supported.
- Ledger integrity tests added.
- Strict roadmap decision schema connected to the successful, risk-approved
  portfolio-construction boundary.
- Unique portfolio snapshot IDs and duplicate-decision protection added.
- Research data cutoffs and pipeline/policy/portfolio versions flow into each
  selected holding's decision record.
- Codex-builder / Claude-challenger branch and review policy documented.
- Test collection side effects isolated from live research and valuation data.
- Phase 1 architecture, data-source, deployment and investment-methodology risk
  register completed.

## Still required before Phase 2

- Commit and review the Phase 1 change set separately from generated data.
- Resolve local-ledger concurrency and atomic portfolio/ledger persistence before
  unattended AWS operation.

## Safety invariants

- Execution remains `RECORD_ONLY` or paper-only.
- No broker credential or live-order path may be introduced in Phase 1.
- Tests must not write into the repository's live `data/` history.
- Existing user data changes must not be staged with Phase 1 source changes.

## Next action

Review and commit the isolated Phase 1 source changes. Then begin Phase 2 by
installing Claude Code and using Claude as an adversarial reviewer of this
branch; do not give it permission to modify the same files during review.
